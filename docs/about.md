# About me

I am a 5th year student at UC Berkeley studying Genetics & Plant Biology and Computer Science. I created this website to showcase some things I have created out of my interests and to provide a space for my thoughts.

    Things I am currently working on:

    * This website
    * Grad school apps
    * Secret comp bio project
